Welcome to Code Haumana
=======================

In this project each of you will have your own project file (i.e. `/haumana/your-name.js`) where you can create a p5.js sketch.

To run your sketch click "üï∂ Show" in the header, select the "Next to the Code" option, and then click the link to your page. Updates to your code will instantly refresh the page. To avoid having to constantly navigate back to your page, you can click the "Change URL" button at the top of the display and enter the path to your page (i.e. `/haumana/your-name.html`).

Please only edit _your own_ project files! Be respectful of your fellow students.

P5.js
-----

P5.js is a Javascript library for drawing graphics in a web browser. It includes numerous functions for drawing 2d and 3d graphics, creating interactive controls, and getting user input. You can also use any standard browser Javascript capabilities alongside p5.js. For examples of the kinds of things you can do with p5.js take a look at the [OpenProcessing.org Gallery](https://openprocessing.org/browse/#).

For help using the functions in the p5.js library see the [p5.js Reference](https://p5js.org/reference/).
